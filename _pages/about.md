I am broadly interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in
ensuring that sophisticated AI systems will robustly and reliably carry out the
tasks that we want them to.

If you're a student at Stanford (undergraduate/masters/PhD) who wants to work on
a project involving safe and reliable machine learning: get in touch!

I studied Physics as an undergraduate at Cambridge University before switching
area to take a Computer Science Master's Degree. My Master's thesis was in the
area of Bayesian inference for timeseries, investigating variational methods for
inference in Gaussian Process State-Space Models. I was supervised
by [Carl E. Rasmussen](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/carl)

After graduating, I spent a summer at
the [Centre for Human Compatible AI](http://humancompatible.ai) at
UC Berkeley, working with [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell)
and [Daniel Filan](http://danielfilan.com) on new approaches to incorporating human irrationality into
Inverse Reinforcement Learning. I presented a poster on this work at
the [First workshop on goals and specification](https://sites.google.com/view/goalsrl/home)
in Reinforcement Learning at ICML 2018. In my spare time, I
took on a project on efficiently parallelizing Long Short-Term Memory units
(LSTM)s in collaboration with Eric Martin, where we were able to obtain a 9x
speedup for several popular RNN architectures. I presented the work as a poster
at [ICLR 2018](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkHEwdgCZ).

For the nine months until June 2018, I worked at the Future of Humanity
Institute at Oxford University, collaborating
with [Owain Evans](https://owainevans.github.io) on scalable human
supervision of complex AI tasks.
